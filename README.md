# ShakeShake-Replication
ShakeShake-Replication is a clean, minimal PyTorch skeleton for reproducing the Shake-Shake regularization paper and experimenting with forward/backward stochastic mixing. It focuses on theoretical implementation rather than training or benchmarking, so the core math and layer behavior can be inspected and modified easily.
